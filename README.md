# tracker-consent-validator
Chrome extension that audits sites for consent violations by monitoring third‑party requests, detecting consent banners/cookies, and flagging trackers that fire before consent or after rejection. Exports JSON reports, supports per‑site enablement, and uses a configurable tracker DB.
